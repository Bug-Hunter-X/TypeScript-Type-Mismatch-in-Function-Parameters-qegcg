# TypeScript Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in TypeScript: type mismatches in function parameters.  The `bug.ts` file contains code that will throw a type error during compilation because a string is passed to a function expecting a number.  `bugSolution.ts` shows how to correct the issue using type guards or input validation.
